Taken from website:


"The Met Office temperature record, HadCRUT4, is widely quoted as a
measure of global warming. However observations are only available for
about 84% (five sixths) of the planet. The omitted region includes the
Arctic, which is warming much faster than the rest of the planet. As a
result, HadCRUT4 underestimates the rate of warming in recent years.

We have developed a method for using satellite data to fill in the
gaps in the Met Office data. Our global record suggests that surface
temperatures have been warming two and a half times faster than Met
Office estimates over the past 16 years. Temperature trends starting
in 1997 or 1998 are particularly affected."

"Temperature files contain 5 columns: date, temperature, total
uncertainty (1σ), coverage uncertainty (1σ), ensemble uncertainty
(1σ). Map data are in a similar format to the ascii files provided by
Hadley or NCDC, i.e. 1 line with year and month followed by 36 lines
of 72 values."
