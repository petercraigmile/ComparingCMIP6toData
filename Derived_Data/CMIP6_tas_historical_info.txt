global tas from CMIP6 from the years 1880 - 2014, K=318 runs in total.
(Originally historical - started with raw grid, monthly data)

The monthly anomalies are calculated relative to the years 1880 - 2014.

List structure of CMIP6:

years       : year vector of length N

model.anoms : matrix of dimension N x K

model.names : the names of the K CMIP6 models

runs        : nearly all "i1p1f1" for this dataset, but there are some
	      exceptions.  See below.
